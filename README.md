## Mental Health in Tech
This project I plan to act as a consultant who is interested in finding out whether mental health is being addressed properly within the tech industry. 

### Description
For this project I posed as a consultant for a tech company looking to make sure their mental health benefits were the same or better than others in the tech industry. Some of the things that I explored were benefit knowledge by country, family history of mental health issues and respondent seeking treatment, age groups and their willingness to share their mental health with either coworkers or supervisors, and the different genders willingness to share mental health struggles. By looking at this data I was able to make a few suggestions for my "client" which was making sure to market available benefits so employees are aware of current offerings, adding more wellness programs and resources to seeking help, and making sure on a global level to structure benefits around country customs and beliefs.
